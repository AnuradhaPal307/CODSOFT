# MACHINE LEARNING INTERNSHIP BY CODSOFT
This repository is used for my Tech Internship(Machine Learning) which contains my all given task projects
# TASK 1:SPAM SMS DETECTION
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages

# TASK 2: CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription- based service or business. Use historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to predict churn.

# TASK 3: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
